# User Guide
Welcome to the Virtual Bazaar; this is a brief user guide to the platform's features and
working. The Virtual Bazaar is a platform where you can find your needs in just one
click. And for that, first, you need to Signup and choose how you want to log in, and a
user can log in as a Customer or Retailer or as a Delivery Person. 

Once you decide as a Customer, you must enter the essential details like Name, Age, address, and
pNO. Etc. After feeling the elements, a user as a Customer can view products that
are surfing through what's present there, which they can buy. The customer can then
add the products as much as they would like to their cart in as much quantity as they
want. The customer can then place the order by making the transaction. The
customer can check the delivery details, such as when they should expect their order
to get delivered or can contact the delivery person for any problem. A unique filter is
also provided for the customers to sort the products based on the minimum price
available after different discounts.


The other mode in which users can log in is the Retailer, a manner for sellers to sell
their products on the Virtual Bazaar. So for this mode also, the user must first enter
the essential credentials to let them sell their kinds of stuff like Name, age, address,
phone number etc. Next, a Retailer gets two options. First is whether they can add
products to the store, and the other one is whether they can see the statistics of their
products, like how many customers bought that particular product or should the
retailer increase or decrease the quantities for selling and discounts.
So if the Retailer chooses the first mode to add the products to the store, they need to
enter the technical details such as Product ID, Category ID, Price of the product,
product Name, how much discount they want to provide, and the product quantity.
And for the second mode, the portal will offer all possible statistics with one click on
that option.


The last option to log in with which a user can enter is a Delivery Person. For the
same, the user needs to enter all the details showing them on the screen, and then
that delivery person will be assigned to a particular delivery as soon as the customer
makes the transaction.


Further, some special filters are present on our portal with whose click a user can see
different statistics. For example, Suppose a user chooses the statistical Section of the
Virtual Bazaar. In that case, the first option a user gets to see is to see the statistics of
the average price of products and categories by their product name and category
name. 

The second option they get to see is the Maximum number of products
ordered by their classes, along with their category name and product name. The third
option they get is to know the average cost, which is grouped by category and
product names. The fourth option a user receives is the total revenue grouped by
category and product. And last but not least, a user can see the statistics of the
product quantity and products' names by their average prices.
